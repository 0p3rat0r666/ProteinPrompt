![*☆*](https://xaoiui.neocities.org/Limestar.gif) In biology we are going over protein synthesis and I had this idea. When Ishowed my teacher she told me if I do it she'll give me extra credit!! :DD ![*☆*](https://xaoiui.neocities.org/Limestar.gif)

![*☆*](https://xaoiui.neocities.org/Limestar.gif) Basic idea is that it'll show a strand of mRNA and you must look at your protein chart and type in the first three letters of each animo acid per codon( Glutamine is gln and glutamate is glu). If you enter the correct strand you get a point and it goes to the next question. ![*☆*](https://xaoiui.neocities.org/Limestar.gif)
